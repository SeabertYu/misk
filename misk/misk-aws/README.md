# Module: AWS SQS Module
**[Module Documentation Pending]**

## Metrics
This module automatically generates metrics related to SQS, including metrics provided by AWS through cloudwatch. These metrics are defined by the `SQSMetrics` class, and are as follows:

| Metric                                                  | Slug                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Labels                                       | Type                                                                                      |
